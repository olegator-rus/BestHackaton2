    - dial to IP directly
    - shell commands in http parameters
    - masquerated protocol (by using well known ports for example)
    - http content type does not match content

- add a transform to open executable files for analysis, set tool via env var
- make general Audit record archive transform: To Summary: Number of Records, Total Size, Fields and Value Distribution

entities:

- add different colors for Internal and External IPs: or merge them? Also rename device ip to source ip and contact ip to destination ip
- add different colors for audit record archives?
- handle multiple cpe identifiers for a single service probe

- add file extraction for POP3 emails and attachments

- GetNotWWW (no www.local reverse DNS name?)
- GetUnknownFlows(Filtered) (no http, pop3 flows)
- GetHostsForGeolocation
- GetApplicationsForCategory is broken

- Create a netcap.Query entity: Add Execute and run the custom query
- link src to dst ports?
- improve DisplayInformation to allow tracking updates to an entity over time

- check if order of values in maltego list matches the timestamps
- Application: add timestamps when packets have been seen, currently the first seen timestamp for the associated ip profile is repeated

## General

## Notes

When switching sync.Mutex variables with the deadlock.Mutex variant for debugging,
the following can be used to fix the imports after applying the global find and replace:

    directories=$(go list -f {{.Dir}} ./...)
    test -z "`for dir in $directories; do goimports -w $dir/*.go | tee /dev/stderr; done`"
