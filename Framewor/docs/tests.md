# Unit Tests

## Prerequisites

Some of the tests operate on a dump file that is not in the repository.

You can download it with:

```text
$ zeus download-test-pcap
```

which will basically just invoke:

```text
wget https://weberblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Ultimate-PCAP.7z
```

Now unpack the file and move it to the tests folder in the project root.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests have been implemented for parts of the core functionality. Currently there are basic tests for reading pcap data from files and traffic live from an interface, as well as tests and benchmarks for common utility functions, such progress displaying and time conversions. 

The tests and benchmarks can be executed from the repository root by executing the following from the project root:

```text
